# ðŸŒ± About Me 
Welcome on my profile! 
I am Karoline, about to finish my studies in Medicine. My desire for innovative thinking and developing led me to discover my passion for programming. My current hands-on software project as a working student further encourages me to dive deeper into IT/ Software Development. I am curious to learn more about software, data and programming to solve real-world problems as part of a diverse team.

## Bill of Material (BOM) Application [@Finepower Gmbh](https://www.finepower.com/): 
* [Private Repository](https://github.com/Karoline0097/BOM_finepower/blob/main/README.md) from my working student job [@Finepower Gmbh](https://www.finepower.com/)
* Private Repository, code & application can be presented & explained via screenshare

### Development of an in-house application for process optimization
* Automate search, managment and order of hundreds of PCB components for PCB prototype assembly with big hardware suppliers Mouser and Farnell 
* Optimized for current supply shortages of power electronic products

### Requirements
* PCBs are designed by hardware engineers using a pcb software (Eagle). For each electric component on this PCB, an appropriate manufacturer part number that fulfills the requirements for the component is choosen by the hardware engineer. Before PCB prototype assembly in the company, a bill of material (BOM) with all electric components with those manufacturer part numbers  is created. For each item on the BOM, a product must be choosen and ordered from hardware supplier online shops (Mouser, Farnell...).
* Problem to solve: 
Manual search of all products by the hardware enigneer and creation of carts by the office manager are very time-consuming processes. Especially now due to current supply shortages in the hardware industry, a considerable amount of working time is spent searching the online shops of hardware suppliers repeatedly for every component on the PCB.
### Functional Requirements
* User Groups: Hardware Engineers, Office Manager
* Application Period: Between completion of PCB Design and before PCB prototype assembly
* Files: csv file with PCB components imported from PCB Design Software, database file to save BOM to/open existung BOM
*	Several hardware engineers work together on the same PCB. Therefore, the BOM inside the application will be created, edited and contributed to by multiple users over a period of time. The application should keep track of sources of manufacturer part numbers and relevant changes to a BOM (with a timestamp and user responsible for the action).
* A BOM consists of many PCB components, for each of witch a manufacturer part number is predefined by the hardware engineer inside the PCB design software. For each of those manufacturer part numbers, products should be automatically searched with hardware suppliers, presented in an user-friendly way and saveable for later work (with the same or another user).
* The choice between multiple search results for a PCB component is faciliated by usre-friendly display of product availability, properties like minimum order quantity, and match between manufacturer part numbers of BOM item and search result. The application can preselect a suitable product for order, however, ultimate choice will be done by the hardware engineer.
* For one PCB component, several manufacturer part numbers can be added either by csv import or by the user inside the application. 
*	Once completed, the BOM with all products selected for order will be send to the office manager who can automatically create corresponding carts with supplier online shops. Automated ordering is not allowed due to legal regulations and must therefore be performed manually by the office manager.
*	Software should be easily maintainable and extendable (e.g. more suppliers) later on

### Process/ System Design Requirements
* IDE: PyCharm Community Edition
* Programming Language: Python
* Database: SQL Relational Database, serverless DBMS SQLite 
* Libraries/Frameworks: must all be Open Source
* Development Method: OOP / FP
* Files: csv, db

### Software Architecture: Layered Model
* UI
* Application Logic
* SQL Relational Database & SQLite DBMS
* Mouser, Farnell Web APIs (JSON)
* [Mouser API](https://www.mouser.de/api-hub/)
* [Farnell API](https://partner.element14.com/docs/Product_Search_API_REST__Description)
