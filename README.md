# ðŸŒ± About Me ðŸ”¬
Welcome on my profile! 
I am Karoline, about to finish my studies in Medicine. My desire for innovative thinking and developing led me to discover my passion for programming. My current hands-on software project as a working student further encourages me to dive deeper into IT/ Software Development. I am curious to learn more about software, data and programming to solve real-world problems as part of a diverse team.

# My Projects:

## BOM App @Finepower: 
* [Private Repository](https://github.com/Karoline0097/BOM_finepower/blob/main/README.md) from my working student job @Finepower GmbH
* Repository is private, but code & application can be presented & explained via screenshare
## Development of an in-house application for process optimization
* Automate search, managment and order of hundreds of PCB components for PCB prototype assembly with two of the biggest hardware suppliers Mouser and Farnell 
* Optimized for current supply shortages of power electronics products
### Requirements: The Problem
*	Before prototype assembly, the engineer chooses an appropriate manufacturer part number for each electric component on a PCB
*	Manual search by the engineer with supplier websites (Mouser, Farnell ...) is a very time-consuming process, especially now due to current supply shortages in the hardware industry
* IDE: PyCharm Community Edition
* Programming Languages: Python, SQL
* Database: SQLite (serverless SQL database engine)
* Libraries: must all be Open Source
* Development Method: OOP
### Software Architecture: Layered Model
* UI
* Application Logic
* SQLite Database
* Mouser and Farnell Web APIs (JSON)

### Screenshots of BOM Tool:

* Work with csv and db files

* Search & Update Product Results from Mouser & Farnell APIs
* choose a product for order with pulldown menu
* visually display status of choosen product

* view more information on a PCB Component (related Part Options, Search Results...)

* manually add own part options for a pcb component
* this function provides more flexibility which is needed due to current supply shortages
