## ðŸŒ± About MeðŸ”¬
Welcome on my profile! 
I am Karoline, about to finish my studies in Medicine. My desire for innovative thinking and developing led me to discover my passion for programming. My current hands-on software project as a working student further encourages me to make a lateral move into IT/ Software Development. I am curious to learn more about software, data and programming to solve real-world problems as part of a diverse team. 
After all, good software is also a crucial part of healthcare!
