# ðŸŒ± About Me ðŸ”¬
Welcome on my profile! 
I am Karoline, about to finish my studies in Medicine. My desire for innovative thinking and developing led me to discover my passion for programming. My current hands-on software project as a working student further encourages me to make a lateral move into IT/ Software Development. I am curious to learn more about software, data and programming to solve real-world problems as part of a diverse team. 
After all, good software is also a crucial part of healthcare!

# Learning Progress
* Self learning to program since 02/22 with:
* Hands On Project: Working Student in Software Development @Finepower Gmbh
* [Software Development Lifecycle](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/software-development-lifecycle?)
* [MITx Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python 6.00.1x ](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7).
* [University of Michigan Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).

# Programming Languages
* Python 
* SQL 
# Relational Databases
* SQLite


# My Projects:

## BOM App @Finepower: 
* [Private Repository](https://github.com/Karoline0097/BOM_finepower/blob/main/README.md) from my working student job @Finepower GmbH
## Development of an in-house application for process optimization
* Automate search, managment and order of hundreds of PCB components for PCB prototype assembly with two of the biggest hardware suppliers Mouser and Farnell 
* Optimized for current supply shortages of power electronics products
### Requirements: The Problem
*	Before prototype assembly, the engineer chooses an appropriate manufacturer part number for each electric component on a PCB
*	Manual search by the engineer with supplier websites (Mouser, Farnell ...) is a very time-consuming process, especially now due to current supply shortages in the hardware industry
* IDE: PyCharm Community Edition
* Programming Languages: Python, SQL
* Database: SQLite (serverless SQL database engine)
* Libraries: must all be Open Source
* Development Method: OOP
### Software Architecture: Layered Model
* UI
* Application Logic
* SQLite Database
* Mouser and Farnell Web APIs (JSON)
